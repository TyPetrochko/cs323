TODO:

1) Consolidate
2) Fix triple error bug
3) Fix file being replaced by directory
4) Fix directory being replaced by file
5) For 3 & 4, look to extractFileFromArchive command
6) Make sure you don't overwrite nameBuffer array

THEN 

1) Handle read-only directories better
2) Consolidate all commands into one
3) Make sure that when an invalid name 
    for a file is given, it yields an appropriate error (ideally put this at 
    top of consolidated function, with a "validateArchive(char * path)" 
    function)
4) Make sure file permissions are correct on extracted files
5) Make sure it works with paths starting with "/"
6) Make sure corrupted archive files fail gracefully
