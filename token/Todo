FIRST/FOREMOST

Optimize strip comments, and possible lineComplete  for faster return values


a) Fix for null characters
b) Get test 12 working
c) TEST 13
d) Get stripcomments O(n) rather than n squared
e) Do the same for getLineTokens

1) Refractor lineincomplete code so that getLine is not O(n squared)
    i.e. count number of valid quotes or something
2) Fill in tokendict, etc.
3) Try these cases:
    i) Type a quote, then send EOF
    ii) Type a quote, hit enter, then send EOF
    iii) Escape a linebreak, and give EOF before linebreaking
    iv) Escape a linebreak, hit enter, and give EOF
